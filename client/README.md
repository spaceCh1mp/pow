For developers trying to run the client as a stand-alone, run the command
> npm install.

To start the React application, run:
> npm start

Now it's time to run the envoy image. Ensure that you have docker installed on your system, for a step by step guide to install docker on your local machine visit [docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

Run:

    :~client$ docker build ./src -t pow/envoy:latest
    :~client$ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --net=host pow/envoy

The first command creates an image from the dockerfile in client/src/

The second command runs the docker image and binds the hosts port 8081 to the container. "--net=host" does ...

To see containers that are running use:

    :~$ docker container list
